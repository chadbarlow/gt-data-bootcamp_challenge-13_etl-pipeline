<h1 align="left">ETL Pipeline<br><i>Topic: Crowdfunding Campaigns</i> </h1> 

The purpose of this project is to build an ETL pipeline that extracts, transforms, and loads data related to crowdfunding campaigns into a structured format, enabling further analysis and insights. The pipeline generates organized information, which can be used in other applications such as predictive modeling, data visualization, or recommendations. By providing a comprehensive view of crowdfunding campaigns, this project can potentially facilitate better decision-making for stakeholders and help identify key trends or patterns.
